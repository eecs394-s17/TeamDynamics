\f0\fs24 \cf0 Emma\
- MADE, Junior\
- A lot of previous team project experience\
\
Issues with previous module\
- Had 5 teammates, but Excel template built for 4 teammates. Had to manually add one.\
\
Features Liked on Team Dynamics\
- Option to add/remove a form\
- Tabs that separate teammates\
- Save as draft feature\
\
Confusing UI\
- \'93Start a new form\'94 should be on top \
- Dashboard: is it for the whole class or me?\
\
Future \'85\
- Clearer of BET/BEAR while still displayed on one page\
- Have a green checkmark that indicates \'93completed\'94 for each section\
- Explanation on BET/BEAR, and example text for each section (that goes away when typing starts)}
